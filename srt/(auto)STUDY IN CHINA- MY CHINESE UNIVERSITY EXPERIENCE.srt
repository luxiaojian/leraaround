00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,120
hey guys what's up welcome to another

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,309
video from bringing in this video I'm

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,110
going to tell you guys a little bit

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,019
about my University I'm going to try to

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,969
tell you how I went through the whole

6
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:17,789
process of like you know applying for

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,410
scholarships applying for the degree

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,119
getting to university starting

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,029
University and how my university is like

10
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,650
so what I'm sort of you and let's get

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,510
started I have been to Chinese

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,670
universities before so this was not the

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,679
first time I was applying for a Chinese

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,690
university so I had a little knowledge

15
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,730
about how to go through these processes

16
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,300
and what to expect when getting at

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,520
university basically I started out by

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,860
looking around for a degree I really

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,629
wanted to study I knew that I wanted to

20
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,059
study in English so and that kind of

21
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,399
limited the degrees very fast

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,739
basically I only found two degrees with

23
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,770
the journalism in English and those two

24
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,199
were two universities in Beijing one was

25
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,329
one I am doing right now and the other

26
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,879
one was another one at Shanghai

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,680
University which is a better University

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,750
than one I do right now

29
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,970
about because I chose this one because

30
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,520
of other reasons as well after finding

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,650
the University I wanted to go to I

32
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,570
applied for the scholarship I also

33
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,600
applied for the University it's two

34
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,060
separate application procedures so you

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,890
have to make sure that you apply for

36
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,830
both and then first I receive one and

37
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,509
then I received the other and I was like

38
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,970
yay now I can do this after receiving

39
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,619
the confirmation of the scholarship I

40
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,360
send that to the University and tell

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,220
them this is my scholarship and then

42
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,750
they put it together and it actually

43
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,000
everything went really smooth then I got

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,369
a health check at home in Denmark first

45
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,350
and then I got my visa and then I went

46
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,780
to China I want to turn a little early

47
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,280
so in the beginning I couldn't go to

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,930
university because they didn't open up

49
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,850
before in the end of August or like the

50
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,710
beginning of September this is very

51
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,090
common so if you want to go to China

52
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,710
before that you have to make sure that

53
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,390
you have another place to stay cuz the

54
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,130
dorm is not going to be open before a

55
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,710
few days before University start anyways

56
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,810
so I went to the university I went to

57
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,369
international office I was looking

58
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:06,350
around where

59
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,730
in the beginning I couldn't really find

60
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,070
anything but I asked you to bid around

61
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,840
and everyone was really nice there are

62
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,760
some other Chinese University students

63
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,130
sitting on campus and waiting for the

64
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,200
Chinese students to arrive so they were

65
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,760
really helpful and they tried the best

66
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,350
to tell us where to go first I went

67
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,090
through international office and the

68
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,920
dorm and they signed me up and they put

69
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,990
me in a dorm room with another girl who

70
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,180
was really nice and then I put all my

71
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,490
stuff there as well and I was like

72
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,709
playing around for a week I got to know

73
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:35,990
some of the other people on campus some

74
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,400
of the other international students we

75
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,500
had some parties together it was a lot

76
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,600
of fun and then one week later our

77
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,090
trusses started I just followed the

78
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,790
schedule I met my classmates we had a

79
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,800
lot of fun together it was actually a

80
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,320
really simple process the university is

81
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,900
very nice it's the smaller than the

82
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,300
biggest universities in Beijing which is

83
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,040
lovely I think for me because then you

84
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,840
can bike around it's very fast to get

85
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,730
around and easy to get out of campus and

86
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,120
in again and a lot of and everyone there

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,000
is super nice also at campus would you

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,430
have like library cafes restaurants in

89
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,100
every supermarket or hairdresser and we

90
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,049
have all the classrooms of course and

91
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:17,840
the dorm and stadium and a gym and a

92
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,670
pool we had everything there so

93
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,980
basically your life can be only at

94
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,720
campus you don't even have to leave the

95
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,790
campus which i think is pretty awesome

96
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,010
so yeah that's like a little bit about a

97
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,870
university I'm going to show you guys a

98
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,299
few clips from my University campus

99
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,769
because I personally think it's so

100
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:35,180
beautiful you're not going to need

101
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,160
anything we also have a subway by the

102
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,959
way so if you can get a sandwich when

103
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,730
you're getting excited of Chinese food I

104
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,980
get that a lot so that's really lovely

105
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,930
for me anyways one problem though is

106
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,440
that my degree is kind of messy

107
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,760
basically I was supposed to study

108
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,620
international journalism but because

109
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,140
they have to English 12 degrees they put

110
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,850
them together because they're not that

111
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,420
many students so I study international

112
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,260
journalism and that's what's going to

113
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,540
say on my certificate afterwards but

114
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,660
basically I only study courses

115
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,519
concerning new media because that's the

116
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,900
other degree and it seems like more

117
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,640
professors like to talk about that I

118
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,220
don't like that part because I don't

119
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,799
learn to write anything and I also don't

120
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:17,560
learn the rules about your

121
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,170
in China I would have loved to know more

122
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:20,920
about that

123
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,200
luckily I'm also very curious about your

124
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,639
media and maybe I should have chosen

125
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,770
that degree instead of I realize this

126
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,530
later on so for me it's not that bad but

127
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,020
I'm just saying that don't expect too

128
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,970
much when you get to China it's more of

129
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,540
a cultural experience and it looks good

130
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,910
on your CV and like obviously if you go

131
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,070
to the best universities they're going

132
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,240
to be hard on you you're going to learn

133
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,980
more I see that with some of my friends

134
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,450
who are at such universities like that

135
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,190
you have more things they have to hand

136
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,160
in and write instead of that but not

137
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,830
that much at my university but it's time

138
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,360
for me because then I have time to do my

139
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,680
own thing and that was one of the

140
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,810
reasons why I chose a small university

141
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,480
because I knew this already at my

142
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,580
university we also have a lot of student

143
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,840
organizations we have a bar so it's like

144
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,030
you're never alone please never be

145
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,560
worried about this because when you get

146
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,000
to China there would be other foreign

147
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,580
students around and I promise you you

148
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,919
have so much fun you might get this

149
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,320
feeling of like being homesick I get

150
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,660
that because I think everyone has that's

151
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,660
not once in a while but it will you know

152
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,820
go away at some point you can check out

153
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,520
a video I made about this so that is

154
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,919
basically a little introduction about my

155
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,350
degree I'm going to study until next

156
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,440
year but I only have courses until like

157
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,660
in two weeks and we're going to finish

158
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,340
and somebody just sort of picture of me

159
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,380
we're going to finish this course very

160
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,960
soon and then next semester are we going

161
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,030
to do an internship and then the last

162
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,919
half a year I have to write my thesis

163
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:54,490
and scraped then I can finish next year

164
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,500
with a mustace degree from China it's

165
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,660
great experience and I want to stay here

166
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,240
