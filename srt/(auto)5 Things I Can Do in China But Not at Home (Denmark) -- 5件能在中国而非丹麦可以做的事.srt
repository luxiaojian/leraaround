Ling is back and today we're going to

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,860
talk about all the things I can do or we

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,309
can do in China but that we can't do at

5
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,150
home of course it's from a Danish

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,279
perspective so it might be different

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,830
from your experience in China and in

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,380
your country but I'm just talking about

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,510
my own personal experience and please

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,779
leave a comment below about your

11
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,730
experience in your own country and China

12
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,399
or if China is your country China and

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,190
another country whatever you feel like

14
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,079
join the discussion I love to hear from

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,140
you so anyway without further ado let's

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,280
get started

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,700
let's get into this video the first

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,489
thing I feel I can do here but not at

19
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,699
home is to randomly meet and bump into

20
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,550
people and just add them on WeChat yeah

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,670
without a valid reason I talked to add a

22
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,879
nice guy about this last week and I was

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,250
like yeah you know here you can just add

24
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,869
people like you don't have to have a

25
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,880
reason you just add them and be like oh

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,799
yeah let's share we chat information

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,229
contact information and I'm like that's

28
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,900
amazing cuz you bump into so many

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,119
different people everywhere and people

30
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,619
who know people who know people like I

31
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,040
feel like my network social network is

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,799
growing so much fast much faster than at

33
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,829
home because in Denmark you really have

34
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,900
a really you need a really good reason

35
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,689
to add somebody if you don't know them

36
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,240
or if somebody didn't introduce or if

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,820
nobody introduced you to each other so

38
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,740
it is really cool here in China because

39
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,409
then we do need help next time you know

40
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,380
who to talk to and again you can you

41
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,540
know find them on your WeChat and text

42
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,850
them and you don't need a reason you can

43
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,770
just say hello what's up how's it going

44
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,479
and that's okay too

45
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,640
so yeah that's definitely the thing I

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,939
love to do here in China which I just

47
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,170
cannot do at home a second thing I can

48
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,750
do here but not really at home is that

49
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,509
here I'm already different so I feel

50
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,850
like you know I just embrace this

51
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,560
you know I just embrace the fact that

52
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,570
I'm different and just do whatever I

53
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,310
feel like because I'm different no

54
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,080
matter what I do I can wear what I feel

55
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,390
like I can do what I feel of course I

56
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,180
don't act like a crazy insane person or

57
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,340
do really like dumb or illegal things

58
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,210
but you know in Denmark it's just people

59
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,490
kind of dress very much alike everyone

60
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,530
looks very similar and you don't really

61
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,940
go and do something that's you know that

62
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,450
nobody else does and like so when I come

63
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,720
here and a good example is actually my

64
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,940
phone cases because you guys know that I

65
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,190
love the cute phone cases and Danish

66
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,530
people don't really do much like phone

67
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,690
cases and if we do it's only like a very

68
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,050
simple read of not red or white like a

69
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,130
white phone case so I love hear that if

70
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,630
I find a phone case that's insane I just

71
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,930
put it on my phone because nobody really

72
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,090
cares cuz I'm already different and of

73
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,710
course the Chinese people many Chinese

74
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,750
people do it anyway but I feel like

75
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,520
foreigners like my foreign friends here

76
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,530
they tease me a lot about those phone

77
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,600
cases and I get that at home as well but

78
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,300
now I've just you know I've embraced it

79
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,290
so much and like bringing around these

80
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,000
phone cases so when I go back to Denmark

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,570
I use them anyway and it gives me some

82
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,880
attention and sometimes negative but you

83
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,220
know it's mostly just for the fun of it

84
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,100
and it's amazing and it's a I feel more

85
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,020
free yeah because I'm already different

86
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,940
here so I might as well just embrace it

87
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,460
and go for it okay I know that that

88
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,410
third one some of you guys gonna be

89
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,410
probably gonna be angry with me uh

90
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,210
because the third one the third thing I

91
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,190
feel like I can do here but not at home

92
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,200
is to write on the wrong side of the

93
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,470
road and yeah I know that it's illegal

94
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,120
and I know you shouldn't do it but

95
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,790
everyone does it and it's pretty often

96
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,670
very difficult to change to the right

97
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,410
side of the road because of big fences

98
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,740
or bridges and stuff like that so I give

99
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,920
you an example when I come when I bike

100
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,400
to my work I have to go on the wrong

101
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,350
side for a little bit until I meet the

102
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,790
first lights cross lights and anything

103
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,970
of traffic lights and then I could cross

104
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,550
I could if I wanted to drive the

105
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,740
opposite direction for half a mile and

106
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,260
then turn around in the lights there and

107
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,410
then go back but I'm a lazy and everyone

108
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,990
else does it and the same when it comes

109
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,510
to the traffic lights if there's green

110
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,370
light that way first I Drive that way

111
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,080
first if there's a green light that way

112
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,940
first I go that way first and then I go

113
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,680
deal I don't know if that makes any

114
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,110
sense but people they bike together with

115
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,220
pedestrians so it's very common that

116
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,800
you're biking on the wrong side but it's

117
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,630
convenient and because the Chinese

118
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,760
traffic lights it takes really really

119
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,990
long time to change from red to green so

120
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,550
that's what people do and I love that I

121
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,500
can do it here in Denmark even though

122
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,840
there are no cars at the traffic lights

123
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm still stopping and waiting because I

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,470
know if the police comes around I have

125
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,210
to pay a big fine and I don't like that

126
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,360
of course and yeah it's just not really

127
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,160
cool you don't do that in Denmark but

128
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,540
here it's just you know whatever suis

129
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,170
bien bah okay the fourth thing really

130
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,270
amazing thing that you can do here in

131
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,670
China but not really at home is that

132
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,430
it's not that expensive here so you can

133
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,790
eat out every day without going broke in

134
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,830
like two or three days in Denmark that

135
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,870
would be impossible if you have to even

136
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,290
just if you buy like a sandwich if you

137
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,640
look at the same amount of money of

138
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,780
course if you're in Denmark and a

139
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,850
full-time worker of course you have more

140
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,540
money but I'm just saying let's say if I

141
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,610
had five thousand here and five thousand

142
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,160
in Denmark it would be much cheaper here

143
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,650
and because many people never cook here

144
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,920
so the food and restaurants also cheaper

145
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,960
because it's more common to go out and

146
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,540
eat for dinner and lunch instead of

147
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,430
going home and making your own food so

148
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,560
that's really great I can go out and be

149
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,840
social much more than I do at home I

150
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,650
tend to invite my friends to my house at

151
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,550
home to like keep the cost down but yeah

152
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,110
I really like to be outside and be

153
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,180
social so that's an amazing thing I can

154
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,090
do here in China but not really at home

155
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,070
then we have number five number five you

156
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,639
guys can

157
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,460
I'm so disgusting when I say this but in

158
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,409
China

159
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:44,939
something I can do here but not at home

160
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:50,310
is a burping and farting and spitting

161
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,090
yeah because it seems like burping is

162
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,779
whatever nothing nothing here in China

163
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:00,870
you burp and then you move on

164
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,110
farting the same thing I feel like when

165
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,050
people do it here they don't like nobody

166
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,229
really seems to care um and this meaning

167
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,050
again you just blame the pollution and

168
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,509
yeah the farting burping you just blame

169
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:18,090
the food so yeah ice is something you

170
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,300
can do here very free it's very free I

171
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,699
also see people picking their noses but

172
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,000
yeah I'm I'm not gonna do that but I'm

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,159
just saying you know if I accidentally

174
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:31,650
borrow if I fired outside I don't give a

175
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:31,979
shit

176
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,349
and then because nobody else gives you

177
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:37,710
so that's really convenient really nice

178
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,389

179
