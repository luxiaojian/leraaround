00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,510

3
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:13,559
blog

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,090
how are you what's up thinking is back

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,280
with another video and today we're gonna

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,560
talk about the top 5 apps you need for a

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,320
more convenient and better living in

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,469
China yay ok so let's just get started

9
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:34,630
the first app the first time is for

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,170
socializing and it's for you know just

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,850
being able to have a very convenient

12
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,400
life in China you probably guessed it if

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,540
you been here before if you know

14
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,730
anything about Chinese apps well we got

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,610
the WeChat or in Chinese cold ways in

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,270
which you recheck recheck weekend yeah

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,180
so first we chat is really important

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,770
because when you meet new people in

19
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,070
China especially young people we don't

20
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,860
swap like the business cards anymore

21
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,009
which is what we check information but

22
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:07,389
I'm telling you when you're swapping

23
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:09,759
these information please immediately

24
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:12,729
when you swap them write the name you so

25
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:14,439
you can remember who the person is

26
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,420
because Chinese young people have a

27
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,149
tendency to write Nick mix forever

28
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:20,979
waiting for the reach and nibs and it's

29
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:22,600
really confusing when you want to find

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,159
them again you can't find it because it

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,289
change the name and usually also don't

32
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:29,889
use their own profile picture like so

33
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,170
you see your contact information with

34
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,810
little dog as a profile picture and the

35
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,109
name is like dignity it you know how

36
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:40,569
would you know anyway so you can choose

37
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,399
their content name so they can't change

38
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,369
it

39
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,859
mm um so that's pretty cool WeChat is

40
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:47,659
also really convenient because you can

41
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:50,240
pay with the recheck wallet in many

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,530
different stores I'm going to make a

43
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,929
more specific video about that later on

44
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:56,270
because that's another thing

45
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,689
ah you can top up your phone with WeChat

46
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:02,119

47
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:05,539
top up your phone you can find a cap you

48
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:08,959

49
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,260
to your friends it's many differents and

50
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,940

00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,250
difficult to you know explain because

79
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,889
there are so many possibilities within

80
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:37,849
one single app so the third app is

81
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,889
called reach one I know I probably say

82
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,780

83
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,800

00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,810
different serum but um this one is

86
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,000

though I'm not sure if this app is in

97
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:22,160
English so I'm sorry for that in advance

98
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,200
but ask a Chinese friend to help you

99
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,940
little bit in the beginning or install

100
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,610
like hope on your phone and use that

101
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,670
it's really convenient um and really an

102
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,340
app you note if you sit down and look

103
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,050
around there lots of pictures so it kind

104
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,460
of makes sense really fast even though

105
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,330
your journeys so Chanyeol and get those

106
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,000
three apps okay we have number four

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,300
number four is for transport that's

108
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,150
those days when you just really hate the

109
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,590
subway and you don't want to take the

110
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,900
basket of smelly I tell them to get it I

111
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,980
have been there then this app is really

112
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,640
smart it is called dee dee dee dee da

113
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,540
dee dee natura so basically you can find

114
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,560
all the Texas nearby you and you just

115
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,140
right I'm here I want to go to there and

116
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,040
then you can like okay and I think that

117
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,130
part should be in English I'm not

118
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,140
promising but I think it's in English as

119
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,650
well which could be very nice right and

120
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,650
because it's a part of or it was in

121
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,930
reach enten to be checked before so

122
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,090
I'm not saying anything to say no I'm

123
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,070
not saying purchasing I'm not promising

124
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,270
anything but to say in English so you

125
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,240
can find Texas all around - or you can

126
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,460
also download mover if you had Cooper

127
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,230
and hope when you come to China

128
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,060
uber is working perfect to find as well

129
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,220
one problem is just that when you're

130
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,120
caught when you're finding your driver

131
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,370
try these drivers they do not look at

132
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,620
the map and drive there where you are

133
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,770
and find you they will call you so be

134
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,350
prepared many foreign is they don't want

135
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,840
to use uber on TV because of this

136
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,310
because they're nervous and they don't

137
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,230
in the Sun was it rock is going to say

138
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,590
um customer service is not really a big

139
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,870
thing in China so some of the drivers

140
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,850
can be quite angry but last time I

141
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,460

150
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,800

Chinese he just checked how about

166
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,640
written online and then you would use

167
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,740
Google Translate or you know trance

168
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,599
homepage so it's like not the best

169
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,240
transition but you still can get around

170
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,819
which is very smart but again it's also

171
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:40,400

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,370
did there are long words I didn't know

175
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,699
beforehand but then if I need it to buy

176
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:53,710
something a try but a nice plate a

177
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,020
sweater I would just you know search a

178
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,120
word on black I'll put it in Taobao and

179
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,430
then I would like search around and then

180
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,590
I could see oh they call it this but you

181
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,060
also call it that and in a sense

182
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,530
searching new terms and stuff like them

183
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,030
